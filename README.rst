Pybot_geometry is Python package that provides general-purpose tools for fast
prototyping of robotics applications (such as Visual Odometry, SLAM) that
require computing rigid-body transformations. This is a preliminary version that
currently works with 6-DOF (3-DoF Rotational + 3-DoF translation) motions.
