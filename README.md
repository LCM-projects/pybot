## pybot_geometry
*pybot_geometry* is Python package that provides general-purpose tools for fast
prototyping of robotics applications (such as Visual Odometry, SLAM) that
require computing rigid-body transformations. This is a preliminary version that
currently deals mostly with SE(3) or 6-DOF (3-DoF Rotational + 3-DoF
translation) and some support for Sim(3) motions.
